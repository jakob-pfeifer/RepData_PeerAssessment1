## Loading and preprocessing the data

Unzip data to obtain the csv file

``` r
library("data.table")
library(ggplot2)

fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile = paste0(getwd(), '/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'), method = "curl")
unzip("repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",exdir = "data")
```

Reading .csv data into data.table

``` r
activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calculating the total number of steps taken per day

``` r
Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm = FALSE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 

head(Total_Steps, 10)
```

Making a histogram of the total steps taken per day

``` r
ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "red", binwidth = 1000) +
    labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```
Calculating the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

``` r
Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), Median_Steps = median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))]
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
